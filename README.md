# Sunburst Plot using Plotly Express

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a Sunburst plot visualization created using **Plotly Express** in Python. Sunburst plots are hierarchical visualizations that represent relationships in a dataset through nested rings. This project uses a small dataset for demonstration and is scalable for larger data.

## 📊 Features
- Interactive **Sunburst Chart** built with Plotly Express.
- **Hierarchical Data Representation** for easy visualization.
- **Hover Tooltips** to display details on hover.
- Scalable for **larger datasets** with minimal modifications.

## 🛠 Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arpan-14/Sunburst-Plot.git
   cd your-repository
   ```
2. **Install required libraries**
